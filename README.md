### Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment

- **Create a React App**: Use `create-react-app` to set up your environment. Install it via npm or yarn if you haven’t already.
- **Install Dependencies**: If you are using Tailwind CSS, follow their official guide to include it in your project. Avoid using unnecessary libraries to keep the project clean and simple.

### Step 2: Build React Components

- **Class Components**: You can use class / functional components, ensure all components extend `React.Component`.
- **State and Props**: Utilize state and props appropriately to manage data and pass data between components.
- **Lifecycle Methods**: Use lifecycle methods such as `componentDidMount` for API calls or operations after the component renders.

### Step 3: Implementing Styles

- **Tailwind CSS**: If you choose Tailwind, utilize its utility classes to style your components as per the design. Remember to check responsiveness and make adjustments using Tailwind’s responsive prefixes.
- **Manual Styling**: For specific styles or animations not covered by Tailwind, use traditional CSS or inline styles.
